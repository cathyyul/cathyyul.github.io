Yes. This is that first post.

I do not have a specific topic for this website yet. I have several. The reason I am starting this blog is to keep the notes and ideas during my technical reading, and recently my topics include LTE networking and data analysis tools (mostly Python-based stuffs). My day job is about networking and radio protocol design, where I may be able to write about the simulation tools and implementations I play with. In addition, due to the time and efforts I just spent on this website, I obviously will be interested in Jekyll for the next couple weeks too. So far I like it a lot.

Let's see how this goes.

I know this must look super geeky, but a programmer cannot resist ending the first post on a tech blog site with this:

"Hello, World!"
