This is my note for the famous book "Lean startup".

This book consists of three parts:

- Part 1: vision -- talking about the definition of startup and entrepreneurship, focusing on the importance of learning from experimentation.
- Part 2: Steer -- describe the overall procedure of a startup's learning cycle:
  - Making leap of faith assumptions.
  - Repeating test-measure-pivot process
- Part 3: Accelerate -- talking about the acceleration of the cycle.

This post is my notes for part 1.

Chapter 1 starts by discussing the true goal of a startup:

- The true north of a startup is creating a thriving and world changing business. The strategy, the product, and even the fundamental assumptions (i.e. the vision) are all changeable as long as the principle still preserves.
    - To achieve a vision, we deploy a strategy. The strategy has several components:
        - Business model
        - Product roadmap
        - Point of views about partner and competitor
        - Ideas about who the customer will be
    - The product is the end result of the current strategy
- A startup is a portfolio of activities, and the challenge is to balance all activities. In other words, entrepreneurship is management.
- Steering a startup is like driving with a destination. Planning sometimes works and more often does not.
    - The entrepreneur steers the wheel by build, measure, learn feedback loop
    - In the process, one learns to pivot or to persevere the original strategy

Chapter 2 discusses the true definition of startup and entrepreneurship:

- Startup = a human institution designed to create a new product under extreme uncertainty
- Entrepreneur = anyone who is creating a new product under extreme uncertainty
- Product = something encompasses any source of value for the people who become customers

Chapter 3 is about learning -- Learning is the only way to strive in uncertainty.

- The goal is to learn about “what customers really want". The job of an entrepreneur is to find a synthesis between a vision and what customers would accept.
- Traditionally, a company creates value by providing benefits to its customer. However, for startups, who the customer is and what they want are unknown.
- A startup looks to learn what is waste and systematically eliminate the waste of resources. There are two fundamental questions:
    - Should this product be built?
    - Can we build a sustainable business around this set of products or services?
- Validated learning is the process of demonstrating empirically that a team has discovered valuable truths about a startup’s present and future business prospects. Any effort that is not absolutely necessary for learning what customers want should be eliminated. In validated learning, results are demonstrated by positive improvements in the startup’s core metrics during experiments.
- Every product, feature, marketing campaign a startup does is an experiment designed to achieve validated learning

Chapter 4 emphasizes experimenting is the way to learn:

- If you cannot fail, you cannot learn
    - Experiments are better than market analysis
    - We should put the company in a position to observe, interact with and learn from real customers and partners.
    - Success is not delivering a feature. Success is learning how to solve the customers problems.
    - Even when a product fails, it should be a constructive failure with good feedback
- A startup’s effort = experiments that test strategy, i.e. experiments should be the products for a startup.
    - Begins with a clear hypothesis: figure out every component of a plan that is an assumption instead of facts and test them.
    - Design the experiment: predict what should happen and test empirically, starting with Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
    - Discover how to build a sustainable business around vision    
- There are two types of hypothesis
    - Value hypothesis: whether a product really delivers value to customers once they start using it
    - Growth hypothesis : how new customers discover a product or or services
