This is the last part of the series. The last part (although is in part 3 of the book) is generally about how to build an environment that allows innovation to evolve even after a startup has become a mature business.  

## Innovate

- Startup requires 3 structural attributes to be able to succeed
    - Scarce but secure resources
    - Independent authority -- handoffs and approvals slow down the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop
    - A personal stake in the outcome for the team
- Approach: Creating a platform for experimentation — establishing the ground rules under which autonomous startup teams operate
    - Protect the parent organization and startup from each other -- create an "innovation sandbox" for each innovation team
        - Any team can create a true split test experiment that affects only the sandboxed parts of the product or service or only certain customer segments or territories
        - One team must see the whole experiment through from end to end
        - No experiment can run longer than a specified amount of time
        - No experiment can affect more than a specified number of customers within the company's customer base
        - Every team that works inside the sandbox and every product that is built must use the same metrics to evaluate success
        - Any team that creates an experiment must monitor the metrics and customer reactions while the experiment is in progress and abort it if something catastrophic happens
        - Sandbox is also good for providing feedback. The work is done in small batches and delivers a clear verdict quickly.

    - Reintegrate an innovation back into the parent organization if it is successful
        - Cultivate the management portfolio
        - Employees often follow the products they develop as they move from phase to phase
        - Every new innovations competes for resources with established projects, and one of the scarcest resources is talent

- Product phases
    - Initial phase — tackle the challenge of scale
    - Growth phase — important implications for PR, marketing, sales, business development
    - Optimization phase — focus on increasing margins and lower cost
        - New product has been well established
        - Procedures become more routine
        - Operational excellence takes on a greater role
        - Require manager who excels in optimization, delegation, control, and execution
    - Mature phase — dominated by operating costs and legacy products
        - Outsourcing, automation, cost reduction
        - Investment in this area will not help the company achieve top line growth

- Entrepreneurship should be considered a viable career path for innovators inside large organizations
    - Working in innovation sandbox is developing startup muscles
    - At first, the team will take on only modest experiments. The earliest experiments may fail to produce much learning and may not lead to scalable success.
    - Over time, the teams are guaranteed to improve as long as they get the constant feedback of small batch development and actionable metrics and are held accountable to learning milestones
    - The last transition is innovators transform from radical outsiders to the embodiment of the status quo

- Actionable metrics, continuous deployment, overall Build Measure Learn feedback loop necessarily cause teams to suboptimize for their individual functions
    - What matters is how fast we can get through the entire loop.
    - It is known that this loss of productivity is an inevitable part of the transition. Expectation can be set up front.

## Final words

- Management is human systems engineering
- In the past, the man has been first; in the future, the system must be first
- It is insufficient to exhort workers to try harder. Our current problems are caused by trying too hard on wrong things
- Avoid pseudoscience
    - All innovation begins with vision, i.e. intuition. It’s what happens next that is critical.
    - Do not selectively finding data that support our vision. Expose the elements of the vision to true experiments
    - Do not use gross metrics
    - Only by building a model of customer behavior and then showing our ability to use our product or service to change it over time can we establish real facts about the validity of our vision
