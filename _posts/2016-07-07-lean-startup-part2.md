Continuing from part 1, this is my notes for part 2 (Steer), which contains the most important concepts in this book.

We first need to understand the concept of Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop. It is a model of validated learning, which works as the following:

- Phase 1: Build phase — Enter the build phase as quickly as possible with a MVP
- Phase 2: Measure phase — Determine whether the product development efforts are leading to real progress
    - Innovation accounting — allows us to create learning milestones
    - Use actionable metrics
- Phase 3: Learn phase - pivot or preserve
    - If we discover the hypotheses is false, make major change to a new strategic hypothesis

The spirit of lean startup method is to focus on minimizing the total time through the cycle systematically. In other words, focusing on validated learning.

In practice, we execute the cycle by

- Figure out what we need to learn (leap-of-faith assumptions)
    - Note that when we don’t have much data yet in the early days, the plan will be based on intuition. As we go through several cycles the hypotheses will become more and more data-supported.
    - Rule of thumb: test the riskiest assumption first
- Use "innovation accounting" to figure out what we need to measure for validated learning
- Figure out what product we need to build to run that experiment and get that measurement

## Leap-of-faith assumptions

We can categorize the leap-of-faith assumptions by

- Value hypothesis -- what creates values for the customers
- Growth hypothesis -- what is behind the growth

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- The goal of building the MVP should be to test the hypothesis.
    - Deciding exactly how complex and MVP needs to be requires judgement. The goal is to test the hypothesis with minimum efforts.
    - Rule of thumbs: when in doubt, simplify
    - It is important to understand the first product aren’t meant to be perfect
        - Any additional work beyond what was required to start learning is waste, no matter how important it might have seemed at the time
        - "If you don’t know who the customer is, you don’t know what quality is."
- Examples of concierge MVPs
    - The goal is to show the value and get feedback.
    - Example 1: Use a video to show the value without significant investment.
    - Example 2: Use Wizard of Oz testing to demonstrate the complicated service

## Innovation accounting

- Milestone 1: Use a MVP to establish real data as baseline. Record standard metrics that matter to the business.
- Milestone 2: The process of tuning the engine toward the ideal (may take many attempts)
    - Each experiment must have an assumption about where the results show go
    - Measure the actionable metrics to show progress
    - Ends when all the micro changes and optimizations can be done
- Milestone 3: Pivot or preserve

### Metrics

Do not use vanity metrics -- the traditional cumulative numbers used to judge a business are misleading and do not show a clear cause and effect. e.g. total registered users and total paying customers.

Good metrics should satisfy three A's:

- Actionable — demonstrate clear cause and effect
- Accessible:
  - The reports should be as simple as possible
  - Use cohort-based reports to clearly demonstrate the trend
  - Enable widespread access for all employees
- Auditable - we should be able to verify the data
  - The data can be verified by hand, or by talking to customer...etc.
  - The reports should be reproducible, i.e. methods that generate reports must not be too complex and better be drawn directly from the master data.

### Cohort analysis

The cohort analysis looks at the performance of each group of customers (a cohort) independently. Generally, the analysis shows the metric values within the measurement period, e.g. among the people who used our product in this period, here’s how many of them exhibited each of the behaviors we care about (normally represented as percentage for fair comparison).

Cohort analysis is frequently used with split test experiments, or A/B testing. In all cases, the conclusion from cohort analysis should be clear, e.g. we should be able to draw a conclusion from the presented analysis and say "do A is better than B because it grows the percentage of customer cohort X".

### Kanban — ways to measure productivity based on validated learning

Kanban is a useful way to measure productivity based on validated learning, and is also a very popular technique for productivity measurement. The general principle is the following:

- Starting with a list of stories to be tested.
- Stories are cataloged as being in one of the four states
  - Backlog
  - Actively being built
  - Done (technical feature complete)
  - Validating
- Each catalog has a limit of number of stories
- Only after a story is validated can be moved off the board

## Pivot or presevere

Once we have gathered enough data and validated learning, we need to consider whether to pivot or to presevere. A pivot is a special kind of change designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, business model, and engine of growth.

In entrepreneurship, a startup’s runway is the number of pivots it can still make before exhausting resources. Innovation accounting is powerful because it speeds up the feedback loop and therefore leads to faster pivots.

How do we know when is the time to consider pivot? The recommendation is to regularly held a pivot or preserve meetings, where everyone can look for signs of the needs to pivot:

- Decreasing effectiveness of product experiments
- General feeling that product development should be more productive

### Types of pivots
This is a summary of various types of pivots from the book:

- Zoom-in pivot: what was previously considered a single feature becomes the whole product
- Zoom-out pivot: what was previously considered a product becomes a single feature
- Customer segment pivot: confirmed solving the right problem but for a different customer that originally anticipated
- Customer need pivot: confirmed there is a real problem for the same customer but the problem is a different one
- Platform pivot: a change from an application to a platform or vice versa
- Business architecture pivot: switching between high margin, low volume or low margin, high volume
    - e.g. by going mass market
- Value capture pivot: change the ways to capture the value a company creates
- Engine of growth pivot: switch to one of other engine of growth to seek faster or more profitable growth
- Channel pivot: recognized the same solution can be delivered through a different channel
- Technology pivot: discovers new way to achieve the same solution by using a different technology
