I am a computer scientist and a researcher in mobile networking/communications. That means I do simulation modeling, prototyping, data analysis, presentations and writing for a living. This is a place where I plan to use as a storage for my technical notes. This website has just started and I will be adding more and more contents to it. Please feel free to share your thoughts.

BTW, the real me is not only the geek next door who codes for fun but also a travel enthusiast. You are welcome to visit [my travel blog][travel-blog] (sorry, Traditional Chinese only...).
